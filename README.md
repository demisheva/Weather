# Weather 
<h1> Weather applicationusing openweathermap</h1>
<p>The task is to write an application to get the current state of the weather. Use openweathermap.</p>

<h2>Limitations and clarifications</h2>
<p>Since we use only JS without databases and backend, there are things that we cannot do natively. For example, include files (with a list of cities), etc.</p>

<h2>User story</h2>

<p>The user enters the site (page) and receives the weather of the city by default (geopositioning is not used). The user selects a city from the drop-down list - and receives the current weather.</p>
